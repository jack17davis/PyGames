# PyGames
Users can play checkers-like games against another human (locally), a provided AI, or create their own player and provide the name of their file. The user's file needs only to contain the function getMove().

This project started as an extention of a homework from my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course (CS470). I have since used it to practice my python skills.
